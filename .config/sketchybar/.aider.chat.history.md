#### /ask Why are actual values of SSID, IP_ADDR and SPEED not shown when I move my mouse on top of the wifi icon?  

#### Why are actual values of SSID, IP_ADDR and SPEED not shown when I move my mouse on top of the wifi icon?  

Okay, let's analyze the workflow for the WiFi popup:

1.  **Setup (`items/wifi.sh`):**
    *   This script defines the main `wifi` item and its associated popup items: `wifi.ssid`, `wifi.strength`, `wifi.ipaddress`.
    *   Crucially, it sets *initial, static* labels for these popup items: `label="SSID"`, `label="Speed"`, `label="IP Address"`. These are just placeholders.
    *   It assigns `plugins/wifi.sh` as the script for the main `wifi` item.
    *   It sets `updates=when_shown` on the main `wifi` item. This means `plugins/wifi.sh` should run when the popup becomes visible.
    *   It subscribes the main `wifi` item to `mouse.entered`, `mouse.exited`, etc.

2.  **Execution (`plugins/wifi.sh`):**
    *   This script fetches the actual network details (`SSID`, `IP_ADDRESS`, `CURR_TX`).
    *   The `render_popup()` function is responsible for updating the labels of the popup items (`wifi.ssid`, `wifi.strength`, `wifi.ipaddress`) using `sketchybar --set wifi.ssid label="$SSID"` etc.
    *   The `update()` function calls both `render_bar_item()` (for the main icon) and `render_popup()`.
    *   The `case "$SENDER"` block handles events:
        *   `mouse.entered`: Calls `popup on`, which executes `sketchybar --set "$NAME" popup.drawing=on`. This *only* makes the popup visible.
        *   `routine` | `forced`: Calls `update()`, which *does* call `render_popup()` to set the correct labels.

3.  **The Problem:**
    *   When you move the mouse over the icon (`mouse.entered`), only `popup on` is executed directly by that event trigger. The popup appears, showing the initial static labels ("SSID", "Speed", "IP Address") defined in `items/wifi.sh`.
    *   The actual update of the labels inside the popup relies on the `updates=when_shown` property of the main `wifi` item triggering the script *again* (likely with `SENDER=forced` or similar), which then runs the `update()` function containing `render_popup()`.
    *   It seems this second trigger (caused by `updates=when_shown`) might not be happening reliably, quickly enough, or there might be an issue within the `render_popup` function preventing the labels from being updated correctly. The `>/dev/null` at the end of the `sketchybar "${args[@]}"` command in `render_popup` would hide any potential error messages from sketchybar.

**Possible Solutions:**

1.  **Explicit Update on Hover:** Modify the `mouse.entered` case in `plugins/wifi.sh` to explicitly call `update()` *after* showing the popup. This ensures the data is fetched and labels are set immediately upon hover.

    ```diff

       popup off

    ```

2.  **Debugging:** Temporarily remove the `>/dev/null` from the `sketchybar "${args[@]}"` line inside the `render_popup` function in `plugins/wifi.sh` to see if sketchybar is reporting any errors when trying to set the labels.

     update() {

    ```

I recommend trying Solution 1 first, as it makes the update logic more direct and less reliant on the potentially delayed `updates=when_shown` trigger.
